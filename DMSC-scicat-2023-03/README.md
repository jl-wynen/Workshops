# SciCat workshop for DMSC 2023

These are notebooks and helper scripts for the SciCat workshop held at and for DMSC in spring 2023.

See `setup.md` to get started.

A demo workflow can be found in the `workflow` folder.
See in particular `workflow/exercise.ipynb`.
The Python scripts are used to generate the input data for the workflow and not needed for the exercise.
