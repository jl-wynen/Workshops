SciCat Workshopw

- setup instructions
- create raw dataset
- make up simple workflow:
  - ideally use metadata
  - manually set param that needs to be in derived metadata (lambda range? ROI?)
  - scipp or numpy
  
- 2nd part:
    - get derived data of other group: with different value of param
    - plot it
    - is there enough metadata in scicat to find and plot the data?
    - the relevant bit is what comes before
        sc.io.open_hdf(...).plot()
