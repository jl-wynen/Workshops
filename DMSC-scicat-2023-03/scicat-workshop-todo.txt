SciCat Workshop
---------------

- setup instructions
  - pin versions
  - requirements.txt
  - TEST!
- create raw dataset
- make up simple workflow:
  - ideally use metadata
  - manually set param that needs to be in derived metadata (lambda range? ROI?)
  - scipp or numpy
  
- 2nd part:
    - get derived data of other group: with different value of param
    - plot it
    - is there enough metadata in scicat to find and plot the data?
    - the relevant bit is what comes before
        sc.io.open_hdf(...).plot()


Workflow Ideas
--------------

- 1d line with peaks w/ background; select ROi for background; subtract the background
  store ROI in metadata
  how to make selection interesting / ambiguous? (want different results to emphasize importance of metadata)
